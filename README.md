🎢 Roller-Coaster-EDA 🎢
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a roller coaster dataset. The analysis examines various features of roller coasters, such as their speed, height, inversions, g-force, and the year they were introduced.

📊 Data Visualization & Analysis
The data visualization is performed using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These powerful tools offer a deep dive into the relationships between different roller coaster attributes. By analyzing these features, we aim to uncover:

🌟 Trends and insights into how coaster designs have evolved over time.
🚀 How physical characteristics like height and speed relate to rider experiences such as g-force and inversions.
🔑 Key Features:
📥 Data Import and cleanup of roller coaster dataset.
📈 Pairplot matrix for visualizing correlations between key features.
🛠️ Comparative analysis of wood vs steel roller coasters.
📊 Graphical exploration of coaster statistics across time.
